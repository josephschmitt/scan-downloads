# Trigger download folder scan for Sonarr and Couch Potato

Simple script that uses the Sonarr and Couch Potato APIs to trigger scanning of the downloads
folder. This is useful if you use Sonarr or Couch Potato for file renaming, but have another process
you need to run in between downloading and renaming (such as transmuxing through something like
iFlicks or Handbrake). This will allow you to do your extra processing, then when complete call this
script which will tell the app to kick off its renaming process.

## Usage

Simply call the script, passing the `--app` flag to tell it which scan to kickoff.

```sh
./scan-downloads.js --app=couchpotato
./scan-downloads.js --app=sonarr

# Supports scanning multiple apps at a time
./scan-downloads.js --app=couchpotato,sonarr
```

## Configuration

You should update the environment dotfiles to configure your server environments. There are two
`.env` files: `.env.couchpotato` and `.env.sonarr`. Just replace the defaults with the information
that points to your servers, and then run the script.

## Binary Packages

If you don't want to have to install or configure NodeJS on your server that runs the script, you
have the option of packaging up the script into a binary. First make sure to correctly configure the
`.env` files. Then, in your terminal, simply run `npm run pkg`. When it's done, you'll see a `pkg/`
directory with binaries for Windows, Mac, and Linux, which you can then put on your server. The
`.env` files are packaged inside the binaries, so the binary file is all that needs to go on the
server.

```sh
./scan-downloads-macos --app=couchpotato
./scan-downloads-macos --app=sonarr
```
